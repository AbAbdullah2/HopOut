# HopOut
HopOut will allow Hopkins students to quickly and easily host, discover, and RSVP to events happening around them, whether on or off campus! Our app will encourage students to branch out, make new friends, and have fun. Think: a better and user-friendly version of CampusGroups and Facebook Events combined.
